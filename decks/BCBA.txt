Solistic (Tact) Extension[]a verbal response evoked by a stimulus property that is only indirectly related to the proper relation
Split-Middle Line of Progress[]a line drawn through a series of graphed data points that shows the overall trend in the data; drawn through the intersections of the vertical and horizontal middles of each hald of the charted data and then adjusted up or down so that half of all the data points fall on or above and half fall on or below the line
Standard Celeration Chart[]a multiply-divide chart with 6 base-10 (or x10, divide by 10) cycles on the vertical axis that can accommodate response rates as low as 1 per 24 hours to as high as 1,000 per min
Steady State Strategy[]repeatedly exposing a subject to a given condition while trying to eliminate or control extraneous influences on the behavior and obtaining a stable pattern of responding before introducing the next condition
Stimulus Equivalence[]the emergence of accurate responding to untrained and non-reinforced stimulus-stimulus relations following the reinforcement of responses to some stimulus-stimulus relations
Stimulus-Stimulus Pairing[]when 2 stimuli are presented at the same time, usually repeatedly for a number of trials, which often results in one stimulus acquiring the function of the other stimulus
Surrogate Conditioned Motivating Operations (CMO-S)[]a stimulus that acquires its MO effectiveness by being paired with another MO and has the same value-altering and behavior-altering effects as the MO with which it was paired
Systematic Desensitization[]treats fears, anxieties, and phobias and involves substituting one response, generally muscle relaxation, for the unwanted behavior- fear and anxiety
Tandum Schedule[]the response requirements for 2+ basic schedules mys be met in a specific sequence before reinforcement is delivered, no Sd
Teaching Loosely[]Randomly varying functionally irrelevant stimuli within and across teaching sessions; promote setting/situation generalization by reducing the likelihood that (a) a single or small group of non-critical stimuli will acquire exclusive control over the target behavior and (b) the learner's performance of the target behavior will be impeded or "thrown off" should he encounter any of the "loose" stimuli n the generalization setting
Temporal Extent[]every instance of behavior occurs during some amount of time
Temporal Locus[]every instance of behavior occurs at a certain point in time with respect to other events; often measured in latency and IRT
Time-out Ribbon[]a ribbon is worn to indicate that reinforcement is available and taken off contingent on problem behavior to indicate that reinforcement is no longer available
Transitive Conditioned Motivating Operation (CMO-T)[]an environmental variable that, as a result of learning history, establishes (or abolishes) the reinforcing effectiveness of another stimulus and evokes (or abates) the behavior that has been reinforced by other stimulus
Trial-by-Trial IOA[]for discrete trial data based on comparing the observers' count (0 or 1) on a trial-by-trial, or item-by-item, basis
Type I Error[]when a researcher concludes that the IV had an effect on the DV when it didn't (i.e. false positive)
Type II Error[]when a researcher concludes that the IV didn't have an effect on the DV when it did (i.e. false negative)
Unpairing[]2 types1) the occurrence alone of a stimulus that acquires its function by being paired with an already effective stimulus2) the occurrence of the stimulus in the absence as well as in the presence of the effective stimulusBoth undo the results of pairing
Validity (of measurement)[]the extent to which data obtained from measurement are directly relevance tot the target behavior of interest and to the reason(s) for measuring it
Variability[]the frequency and extent to which multiple measures of behavior yield different outcomes
Interval Schedules[]remember that it is for the FIRST RESPONSE after the interval is over
Variable-Momentary DRO (VM-DRO)[]reinforcement is available at specific moments of time, which are separated by variable amounts of time in random sequence, and delivered if the problem is not occurring at those times
Variable-Time Schedule[]a schedule for the delivery of noncontingent stimuli in which the interval of time from one delivery to the next randomly varies around a given time
Verification[]1 of 3 components of the experimental reasoning, or baseline logic, used in single-subject research designs; accomplished by demonstrating that the prior level of baseline responding would have remained unchanged hat the IV not been introduced; reduces the probability that some uncontrolled variable was responsible for the observed change in behavior
